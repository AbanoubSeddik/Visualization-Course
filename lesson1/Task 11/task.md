After setting up the figure, plotting the bars, and adding labels, the final step is to display the chart.

The 

    plt.show()

function renders the chart, making it visible for inspection.

If youâ€™re using a non-interactive environment, this command is essential to see the final output.

<div class="hint">
  Use plt.show() to display the chart and inspect the final output.
</div>
