Labels and legends make the chart readable and help viewers understand the data being presented. Adding x-axis and y-axis labels, a title, and a legend allows for quick interpretation of the chartâ€™s meaning. Setting xticks ensures that genre labels appear directly below each genre group.

In this step:

* `ax.set_xticks` defines the positions for genre labels.
* `ax.set_xticklabels` labels the genres on the x-axis.
* `ax.set_xlabel` and `ax.set_ylabel` give context to the axes.
* `ax.legend` adds a legend that shows the color associated with each platform.

<div class="hint">

    # Define the x-axis ticks positions and labels
    ax.set_xticks([pos + bar_width for pos in platform_positions])
    ax.set_xticklabels(genres)
    
    # Label the axes
    ax.set_xlabel("Genre")
    ax.set_ylabel("Number of Games")
    
    # Add a legend to differentiate between platforms
    ax.legend(title="Platform")
</div>
