In a grouped bar chart,

each genre will have a group of bars representing the different platforms.

To create this effect, we need to position each bar carefully. 

The bar_width sets the width of each bar, while we calculate positions for each genre.

Using 

    range(len(genres)) 
generates a position for each genre, which will be the base position for each group of bars.

<div class="hint">
  Define bar width and calculate the positions for each genre to create grouped bars.

    # Define the width of each bar
    bar_width = 0.2
    
    # Get the list of genres from the index of our data and generate base positions
    genres = genre_platform_counts.index
    platform_positions = range(len(genres))  # Position of each genre group

</div>
