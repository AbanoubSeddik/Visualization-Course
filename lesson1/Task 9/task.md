To create a grouped bar chart, we need to plot a separate set of bars for each platform.

Each platform’s bars will be offset slightly within each genre group to avoid overlapping and create a "grouped" appearance.

This is done by adding an offset to each genre’s position. The loop iterates over each platform, and `ax.bar` is used to plot the bars.

The `ax.bar` function requires:

* `x` positions of each bar, where we calculate an offset for each platform.
* `Heights` of the bars, here represented by the counts of games for each genre on each platform.
* `width` to control the width of the bars.
* `label` to create a legend later for each platform.

<div class="hint">
  Plot a set of bars for each platform, using offsets to position them side-by-side

    # Loop through each platform and plot bars with an offset
    for i, platform in enumerate(platforms):
      # Calculate the offset for each platform's bar position within each genre group
      bar_positions = [pos + i * bar_width for pos in platform_positions]
      
      # Plot the bars for this platform
      ax.bar(
          bar_positions,  # X positions with calculated offsets
          genre_platform_counts[platform],  # Heights based on game counts
          width=bar_width,  # Set width for each bar
          label=platform  # Label for the legend
      )
