## Task 2: Import Required Libraries



To start building any data visualization project, you need to import the necessary libraries. Here, we’re using:


1. **[pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org)** 
for data manipulation. This library is widely used in data science for handling and processing data, particularly in structured formats like tables.



2. **[matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org)** for plotting. It’s a flexible and powerful visualization library in Python, which allows us to create detailed and customized charts.


The reason for separating data manipulation from visualization is to keep the code modular. pandas is efficient for filtering, grouping, and aggregating data,

while matplotlib specializes in visualizing the processed data.


For convenience, we often import these libraries with shorter aliases:

`pd` for **pandas**

`plt` for **matplotlib**

While using these aliases is not mandatory, it is a widely accepted convention that makes the code cleaner and easier to read.

## Installation

Before you can use these libraries, ensure they are installed in your Python environment. You can install them using pip:

1. Go to the terminal &shortcut:ActivateTerminalToolWindow;
2. type this command: `pip install pandas matplotlib`
