## Transition to Visualization

Now that we’re done filtering and organizing our data using Pandas,

we’re ready to move on to Matplotlib to create our visualizations.

**`Matplotlib`** is a powerful library for creating charts and plots, which will help us clearly see the patterns in our data.

## In the next steps,
we’ll set up our figure and start plotting our grouped bar chart to show the number of games by genre across different gaming platforms.
